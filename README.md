# JavaScript Learning Journey

This repository documents my **daily JavaScript learning progress** using **GitHub Codespaces + VS Code**.  
I am learning step-by-step with **hands-on practice** and **daily commits**.

---

## Day 1: Variables & Data Types 

###  Topics Covered
- Variables (`let`, `const`)
- Data Types
  - Number
  - String
  - Boolean
  - Null
  - Undefined
- Updating variable values
- `console.log()` usage
- Basic program execution using Node.js

###  File


###  Programs Practiced
- Store and print values
- Check data types using `typeof`
- Update variable values
- Display multiple values together
- Understand redeclaration vs reassignment

###  Key Learning
> Variables can be **declared once** and **updated many times** using `let`.

---

## Day 2: Conditions (if / else) 

### Topics Covered
- `if` statement
- `else` statement
- `else if` ladder
- Comparison operators (`>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `===`)
- Logical operators (`&&`)
- Decision making in programs

### File

###  Programs Practiced
- Positive / Negative number check
- Even / Odd number
- Voting eligibility
- Largest of two numbers
- Pass / Fail logic
- Grade calculation
- Equality check
- Simple login validation
- Temperature check
- Number range validation

---

###  Key Learning
> JavaScript executes **only the block whose condition is true**.

## Day 3: Loops (for / while) 

Today I learned how to use **loops** in JavaScript to repeat tasks efficiently instead of writing the same code multiple times.

---

### Topics Covered
- `for` loop
- `while` loop
- Loop initialization, condition, and increment
- Using loops with conditions
- Accumulating values using loops
- `break` statement
- Printing output line by line and side by side

---

### File

---

### Programs Practiced
- Print numbers from 1 to 5
- Print numbers from 1 to 10
- Print even numbers
- Print odd numbers
- Sum of numbers using a loop
- Multiplication table
- Countdown using `while` loop
- Repeating text using `while`
- Sum calculation using `while`
- Stop loop execution using `break`

---

### 🧠 Key Learnings
- Loops help avoid code repetition
- `for` loop is best when the number of iterations is known
- `while` loop is useful when the condition controls repetition
- Variables like `sum` must be initialized before accumulation
- `console.log()` prints output line by line
- `process.stdout.write()` prints output side by side

---

## 🛠 Tools Used
- JavaScript (Node.js)
- VS Code
- Git & GitHub
- GitHub Codespaces

---

## 🔁 Daily Routine
1. Learn concepts
2. Write programs
3. Run code using Node
4. Fix errors
5. Commit & push to GitHub

---

## 📈 Progress Status
- ✅ Day 1 completed
- ✅ Day 2 completed
- ⏳ Day 3: Loops (up next)
